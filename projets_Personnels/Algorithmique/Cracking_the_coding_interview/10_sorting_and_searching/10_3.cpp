/*Thoughts
An easy is just to iterate through the array and check if it's our number.
We could try to modify the binary search method where we have one binary search who searches on the left to middle part of the array and another one on the middle to end of the array
if the first one is succesfull we don't run the other.
*/

//comparison between the first elem and the middle one allow us to know if it's ordered and where to look
