/*Thoughts
is the testing being phisical or the program who runs it
again who will use it, where
we just prioritize our testing on making it work 100% and security

check if every button on the machine will give us the result we wanted
the screen display well the info
you can connect to basic info of your bank account
the printing goes well (last payments)
check if you can write number too big/low when you want to withdraw a specific amount of cash
If there is no cash, what happens

the screen is strong enough
