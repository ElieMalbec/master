/*Thoughts
to test a pen : 
i would ask who would use it and why
then i would get people of that range to hold it and see how it feels(too heavy on the front or back, too long, bad material on the grip on the pen)
how well does it write, simulate case when you can break it, resistant to damage fall, using product no harmful for humans
