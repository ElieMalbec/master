/*Thoughts
i would first check if x and y are on the rnage of the board
then i would check if there is one of our unit on x y.
Maybe we need to check if that move is possible depending on our piece (tower cannot go diagonaly) and if the road to go there is correct (a tower  in 8 8 could not go in 4 8 because there is a piece on 7 8 for example)
