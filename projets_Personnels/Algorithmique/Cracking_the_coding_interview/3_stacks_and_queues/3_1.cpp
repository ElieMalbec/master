// Describe how you could use a single array to implement three stacks

/*Thoughts
So we could for example the first item would be for array 1, the second for array 2  and the third for array 3. So for example if there is 17 items and we want to retrieve the first item  of the third stack so it would be the 15th item
*/

//We could divise the array in three different parts (allocate part of the array fo each stack). Then we could use dynamic stacks in the array so the array could use it's max size.
