//Write a program to sort a stack that the smallest items are on the top. You can use an additionnal temporary stack, but you may not copy the elements into any other data structure(such as an array). The stack supports the following operations : push, pop, peek, and isEmpty.

/*Thoughts
We always need to have the second stack to be sorted to be able sort our stack
